# GIFDT-fix (Global Input Fields on Dark Themes Fix)
Fix for unreadable input fields with dark GTK+ themes based on Arch Linux Wiki instructions for Mozilla Firefox.

The css sets input fields to standard black text / white background; both can be overridden by the displayed site, so that colors are seen as intended.
Also fix white font color in light background pages.
