# GIFDT-fix (Global Input Fields on Dark Themes Fix)
Fix for unreadable input fields with dark GTK+ themes based on Arch Linux Wiki instructions for Mozilla Firefox.

The css sets input fields to standard black text / white background; both can be overridden by the displayed site, so that colors are seen as intended.
Also fix white font color in light background pages.

## Dependencies

- Mozilla Firefox

- Stylish addon (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/)

- GIFDT-fix for Stylish (https://userstyles.org/styles/148092/gifdt-fix-global-input-fields-on-dark-themes-fix)
## Installation

Arch Linux
```
$ sudo pacman -S firefox
```

Ubuntu / Linux Mint / ElementaryOS (on Debian, Firefox ESR is the default web browser)

```

After install Firefox, open it and then access the Stylish addon page and click install.
Once Stylish is installed, access the GIFDT-fix page at [userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/styles/148092/gifdt-fix-global-input-fields-on-dark-themes-fix) and click install.
